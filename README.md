# Why Dargen?

Dargen in a genetic algorithm focused on ease-of-use and magic.

  - Just create the decoder.
    - Supply arbitrarily shaped objects with functions.
    - Uses function length or description helper to call with genes.
  - Donâ€™t worry too much about the mutation and crossover mechanisms.
    - Or, take full control and easily create mutation and crossover pipelines.
    - Mutation and crossover pipelines can be unique to the individual and determined according to their genome.
  - Uses robust and simple 0 to 1 (inclusive) genome encoding.
  - Supports genome growth and deletion.
  - Effortless self-reflection.
  - Experimental features and ideas.
